# CSE599-O Fall 2025 Assignment 3: Post-Training via RL

For a full description of the assignment, see the assignment handout at
[cse599o_fall2025_assignment3_post_training.pdf](./CSE599_Assignment3.pdf)

## Setup

As in previous assignments, we use `uv` to manage dependencies.

1. Install all packages except `flash-attn`, then all packages (`flash-attn` is weird)
```
uv sync --no-install-package flash-attn
uv sync
```

2. Run unit tests:

``` sh
uv run pytest
```

Initially, all tests should fail with `NotImplementedError`s.
To connect your implementation to the tests, complete the
functions in [./tests/adapters.py](./tests/adapters.py).
